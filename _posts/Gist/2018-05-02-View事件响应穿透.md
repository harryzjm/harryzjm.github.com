```swift  
//Only respond child view
open class FallthroughView: UIView {
    override open func point(inside point: CGPoint, with event: UIEvent?) -> Bool {
        return subviews.map { [unowned self](v) -> Bool in
            let new = v.convert(point, from: self)
            return v.point(inside: new, with: event)
            }.reduce(false) { $0 || $1 }
    }
}
